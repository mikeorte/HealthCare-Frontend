# HealthCare Application

## Overview

The **HealthCare Application** is a feature-rich, user-centric application designed to empower users to manage their health records efficiently. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), this application offers a seamless interface for tracking health logs, managing prescriptions, scheduling appointments, and maintaining a symptom journal. 

This project showcases my ability to develop a complete frontend application from scratch, utilizing modern web development technologies and adhering to best practices in user experience design.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and signup features for personalized access to health information.
- **Health Log**: Allows users to document and track their health-related data over time.
- **Symptom Journal**: Users can record symptoms and monitor any changes or patterns over time.
- **Appointments Management**: A streamlined way for users to keep track of their upcoming and past appointments.
- **Prescriptions**: Convenient storage and access to current and past prescriptions, with relevant details.
